configurations for this project.

In brief, the requirements are:
- GLFW
- CMake
- GLAD

## Menu Application
At startup, the program will prompt the user to choose the different implementations from the GettingStarted chapter.
Once an implementation is selected, a new window will appear and showcase the work.
